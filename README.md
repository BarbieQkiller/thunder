MQTT is a lightweight and energy-efficient messaging protocol commonly employed in IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) applications for transmitting small pieces of data between devices. 

We will be using Shelly, a company specializing in smart home devices and IoT solutions. Their product range includes smart switches, relays, sensors, and other components designed to seamlessly integrate into a smart home ecosystem.

Our goal is to manage the on/off functionality of a lamp seamlessly using the MQTT protocol and Shelly smart home devices. By leveraging the lightweight and energy-efficient nature of MQTT, coupled with Shelly's specialized smart switches and relays, we aim to create a reliable and efficient system for controlling the illumination of a lamp within a smart home setup.
